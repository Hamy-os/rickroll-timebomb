# WELCOME TO THE ULTIMATE RICKROLL

Made as a prank for my school but published for you to use :)

# HOW TO INSTALL

1. Download the setup.bat file or copy paste it onto the desktop of the computer you want to infect then let the batch file do all the work
2. Run the timer.vbs file

# HOW IT WORKS

1. The Setup.bat file is responsible for downloading the files and starting the FileChecker.vbs file
2. The FileChecker.vbs is responsible for making sure the files have downloaded and starting the Timer.vbs file
3. The Timer.vbs file is responsible for making sure the script starts on time. It starts the  Video.vbs file
4. The Video.vbs file is responsible for playing the 10 second countdown and starting the VolumeUp.vbs file on completion
5. The VolumeUp.vbs file is responsible for setting the volume on the computer to 100% and holding it there while the RickRoll.vbs file plays. It starts the RickRoll.vbs file
6. The RickRoll.vbs file is responsible for playing the Audio file aswell as starting the CleanUp.vbs file on completion
7. The CleanUp.vbs file deletes all of these files and self deletes
